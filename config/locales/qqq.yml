  language_name: |-
    The name of the translation language. For example, it should be "français" in the fr.yml file.

    Note that language names (or adjectives) do not necessarily have a leading capital in all languages, even if they are all capitalized in English, because for example they distinguish the people names (ethnonyms) with the initial capital.

    Translate these language names as appropriate for the common use and as found in dictionnaries, but not necessarily in isolation as a title or heading, so they can be used as qualifiers or in comma-separated lists of languages, but where the capitalization is applied only contextually in very strict contexts with special formatting or grammatical rules (e.g. only capitalized for the first word of a complete sentence, or the first significant word of a book title or chapter heading, or the first word of a verse in poems and lyrics).

          the most endangered among CITES-listed animals and plants. They are threatened
          with extinction and CITES prohibits international trade in specimens of
          these species except when the purpose of the import is not commercial, for
          instance for scientific research. In these exceptional cases, trade may
          take place provided it is authorized by the granting of both an import permit
          and an export permit (or re-export certificate). Article VII of the Convention
          provides for a number of exemptions to this general prohibition.
        http://eol(dot)org/schema/terms/CITES_II: Appendix II lists species that are
          not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so unless
          trade is closely controlled. It also includes so-called "look-alike species",
          i.e. species whose specimens in trade look like those of species listed
          for conservation reasons. International trade in specimens of Appendix-II
          species may be authorized by the granting of an export permit or re-export
          certificate. No import permit is necessary for these species under CITES
          (although a permit is needed in some countries that have taken stricter
          measures than CITES requires). Permits or certificates should only be granted
          if the relevant authorities are satisfied that certain conditions are met,
          above all that trade will not be detrimental to the survival of the species
          in the wild. (See Article IV of the Convention)

        https://eol(dot)org/schema/terms/drag_based_swimming: Drag swimmers use a
          cyclic motion where they push water back in a power stroke, and return their
          limb forward in the return or recovery stroke. When they push water directly
          backwards, this moves their body forward, but as they return their limbs
          to the starting position, they push water forward, which will thus pull
          them back to some degree, and so opposes the direction that the body is
          heading. This opposing force is called drag. The return-stroke drag causes
          drag swimmers to employ different strategies than lift swimmers. Reducing
          drag on the return stroke is essential for optimizing efficiency.

          a net flow of marine water to the surface of the water column from deeper

          into the shell. In bivalves, the foot is adapted for burrowing into the

          derived from distant rivers, and windblown dust. Covering 38% of the ocean

          compound eyes where each ommatidium is equipped with a set of plane mirrors,
          aligned at right angles, forming a square. Rays entering the eye at an oblique
          angle encounter two surfaces of each mirror box rather than one surface.
          In this case, the pair of mirrors at right angles acts as a corner reflector.
          Corner reflectors reflect an incoming ray through 180 degrees, irrespective
          of the ray’s original direction. This ensures that all parallel rays reach
          the same focal point and means that the eye as a whole has no single axis,
          which allows the eye to operate over a wide angle.

          a small image halfway down the structure and the second lens turning the
          image back into a parallel beam. In the process the ray direction is reversed.
          Thus, the emerging beam is on the same side of the axis as the entering
          beam—the condition for obtaining a superposition image from the whole array.
