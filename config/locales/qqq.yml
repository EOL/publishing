qqq:
  language_name: |-
    The name of the translation language. For example, it should be "français" in the fr.yml file.

    Note that language names (or adjectives) do not necessarily have a leading capital in all languages, even if they are all capitalized in English, because for example they distinguish the people names (ethnonyms) with the initial capital.

    Translate these language names as appropriate for the common use and as found in dictionnaries, but not necessarily in isolation as a title or heading, so they can be used as qualifiers or in comma-separated lists of languages, but where the capitalization is applied only contextually in very strict contexts with special formatting or grammatical rules (e.g. only capitalized for the first word of a complete sentence, or the first significant word of a book title or chapter heading, or the first word of a verse in poems and lyrics).

          the most endangered among CITES-listed animals and plants. They are threatened
          with extinction and CITES prohibits international trade in specimens of
          these species except when the purpose of the import is not commercial, for
          instance for scientific research. In these exceptional cases, trade may
          take place provided it is authorized by the granting of both an import permit
          and an export permit (or re-export certificate). Article VII of the Convention
          provides for a number of exemptions to this general prohibition.
        http://eol(dot)org/schema/terms/CITES_II: Appendix II lists species that are
          not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so unless
          trade is closely controlled. It also includes so-called "look-alike species",
          i.e. species whose specimens in trade look like those of species listed
          for conservation reasons. International trade in specimens of Appendix-II
          species may be authorized by the granting of an export permit or re-export
          certificate. No import permit is necessary for these species under CITES
          (although a permit is needed in some countries that have taken stricter
          measures than CITES requires). Permits or certificates should only be granted
          if the relevant authorities are satisfied that certain conditions are met,
          above all that trade will not be detrimental to the survival of the species
          in the wild. (See Article IV of the Convention)
        http://eol(dot)org/schema/terms/CITES_III: Appendix III is a list of species
          included at the request of a Party that already regulates trade in the species
          and that needs the cooperation of other countries to prevent unsustainable
          or illegal exploitation. International trade in specimens of species listed
          in this Appendix is allowed only on presentation of the appropriate permits
          or certificates. (See Article V of the Convention)

        http://purl(dot)obolibrary(dot)org/obo/ENVO_01000063: A marine upwelling is
          a net flow of marine water to the surface of the water column from deeper

          fronts around eddies and along some of the major oceanographic features.
          Deeper waters often have higher nutrient content; consequently blooms of
          primary producers, such as planktonic algae, are generally observed around
          upwelling zones.

          cyclic motion where they push water back in a power stroke, and return their
          limb forward in the return or recovery stroke. When they push water directly
          backwards, this moves their body forward, but as they return their limbs
          to the starting position, they push water forward, which will thus pull
          them back to some degree, and so opposes the direction that the body is
          heading. This opposing force is called drag. The return-stroke drag causes
          drag swimmers to employ different strategies than lift swimmers. Reducing
          drag on the return stroke is essential for optimizing efficiency.

        https://eol(dot)org/schema/terms/harvested_in: This organism is caught or
          collected, and put to human use, in the following region(s)
        https://eol(dot)org/schema/terms/labile_material_feeder: 'consumers specializing
          in labile organic matter, which is easily metabolized; usually low molecular
          weight compounds, eg: simple sugars or proteins. For instance, metabolic
          scaling puts intense selective pressure on small organisms to ingest foods
          rich in labile organic matter; the residence time in a very short gut is
          too brief for enzymatic hydrolysis, so they specialize in rapidly metabolizable
          compounds.'
        https://eol(dot)org/schema/terms/lift_based_swimming: Hydrofoils, or fins,
          are used to push against the water to create a normal force to provide thrust,
          propelling the animal through water. The reduction of fin cross-sectional
          area helps to minimize drag, and therefore increase efficiency. Regardless
          of size of the animal, at any particular speed, maximum possible lift is
          proportional to (wing area) x (speed)<sup>2</sup>. Dolphins and whales have
          large, horizontal caudal hydrofoils, while many fish and sharks have vertical
          caudal hydrofoils.

          of a moss or fern, the antheridia (male) and archegonia (female) reproductive
          organs occur on the same individual plant. They may be borne on different
          shoots (autoicous), on the same shoot but not together in a common structure
          (paroicous), or together in a common "inflorescence" (synoicous).
        https://eol(dot)org/schema/terms/mucus_gliding: muscular waves propelling
          an animal over a mucus layer overlaying the substrate; alternating regions
          of muscular contraction and expansion create traveling waves that shear
          the mucus, resulting in translation of the animal.

        https://eol(dot)org/schema/terms/ostraciiform: Body/caudal fin propulsion,
          with no appreciable body wave when they employ caudal locomotion. Only the
          tail fin itself oscillates (often very rapidly) to create thrust. Typical
          of the Ostraciidae

        https://eol(dot)org/schema/terms/pectoral_oscillation: a type of pectoral-fin-based
          swimming, also known as mobuliform locomotion. Lower frequency than fin
          undulation; can be described as the production of less than half a wave
          on the fin, similar to a bird wing flapping. Pelagic stingrays use oscillatory
          locomotion.
        https://eol(dot)org/schema/terms/polygamodioecious: mostly dioecious, but

        https://eol(dot)org/schema/terms/springing: (Quadrupedal jumping) Progression
          composed of a series of leaps in which the hind legs supply the chief propulsive
          force, lifting the body completely from the ground and forward. The fore
          feet touch the ground simultaneously or in close sequence; the body rolls
          forward over these as in a vault; the hind feet, overstepping the fore feet,
          at least in greatest speed, come down next and again lift the body forward.
        https://eol(dot)org/schema/terms/starfish_feeder: a carnivore that feeds primarily
          on starfishes
        https://eol(dot)org/schema/terms/subcarangiform: Body/caudal fin propulsion,
          like anguilliform, with a more marked increase in wave amplitude along the
          body with the vast majority of the work being done by the rear half of the
          fish. In general, the fish body is stiffer, making for higher speed but
          reduced maneuverability. Trout use sub-carangiform locomotion.

        https://eol(dot)org/schema/terms/thunniform: Body/caudal fin propulsion, characteristic
          of tunas, also found in several lamnid sharks. Virtually all the sideways
          movement is in the tail and the region connecting the main body to the tail
          (the peduncle). The tail itself tends to be large and crescent shaped. This
          form of swimming enables these fish to chase and catch prey more easily
          due to the increase in speed of swimming, like in barracudas.

          or the carpels are missing, vestigial or otherwise non-functional. Each
          flower is either "staminate" (having only functional stamens) and thus "male",
          or "carpellate" (or "pistillate") (having only functional carpels) and thus
          "female". If separate staminate and carpellate flowers are always found
          on the same plant, the species is called monoecious. If separate staminate
          and carpellate flowers are always found on different plants, the species
          is called dioecious.
