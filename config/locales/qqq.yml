qqq:
  language_name: |-
    The name of the translation language. For example, it should be "français" in the fr.yml file.

    Note that language names (or adjectives) do not necessarily have a leading capital in all languages, even if they are all capitalized in English, because for example they distinguish the people names (ethnonyms) with the initial capital.

    Translate these language names as appropriate for the common use and as found in dictionnaries, but not necessarily in isolation as a title or heading, so they can be used as qualifiers or in comma-separated lists of languages, but where the capitalization is applied only contextually in very strict contexts with special formatting or grammatical rules (e.g. only capitalized for the first word of a complete sentence, or the first significant word of a book title or chapter heading, or the first word of a verse in poems and lyrics).

          instance for scientific research. In these exceptional cases, trade may
          take place provided it is authorized by the granting of both an import permit

          limb forward in the return or recovery stroke. When they push water directly
          backwards, this moves their body forward, but as they return their limbs
          to the starting position, they push water forward, which will thus pull
          them back to some degree, and so opposes the direction that the body is
          heading. This opposing force is called drag. The return-stroke drag causes
          drag swimmers to employ different strategies than lift swimmers. Reducing
          drag on the return stroke is essential for optimizing efficiency.

          a net flow of marine water to the surface of the water column from deeper

          coasts by wind action. Localised upwellings may also occur along divergent
          fronts around eddies and along some of the major oceanographic features.
          Deeper waters often have higher nutrient content; consequently blooms of
          primary producers, such as planktonic algae, are generally observed around
          upwelling zones.

          soil. Palsas are characteristically found in areas with discontinuous permafrost

          A palsa needs large quantities of water for the formation of its ice core
          (i.e. ice lens), which is why they frequently emerge from and are bound
          by boggy soils, which can store enormous quantities of water in their pores.

          compound eyes where each ommatidium is equipped with a set of plane mirrors,

          angle encounter two surfaces of each mirror box rather than one surface.
          In this case, the pair of mirrors at right angles acts as a corner reflector.
          Corner reflectors reflect an incoming ray through 180 degrees, irrespective
          of the ray’s original direction. This ensures that all parallel rays reach
          the same focal point and means that the eye as a whole has no single axis,
          which allows the eye to operate over a wide angle.

          image back into a parallel beam. In the process the ray direction is reversed.
          Thus, the emerging beam is on the same side of the axis as the entering
          beam—the condition for obtaining a superposition image from the whole array.
